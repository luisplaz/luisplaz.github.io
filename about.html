		<h3 id="lucida">My Background</h3>

		<p id="info">I was born in Caracas, Venezuela a country in the top of South America thats has borders with Colombia and Brazil. This is a beautiful country with incredible people and natural wonders. We have great coffee as well as chocolate and our biggest source of income is oil.
		I lived in Venezuela until I was 26, there I finished my bachelor in Industrial Engineering and an MS in Finance. This year, 2015, I moved to NYC seeking to broaden my knowledge in programming and interface design having discovered this is a passion of mine in the previous years of work I had in Venezuela.
		Now im here at Devbootcamp after finishing an intro to java and Data Structures course in Columbia to further my knowledge in said field and to solidify my journey into becoming a developer.
		<br><br>
		In a more personal note, I love dogs and anything related to technology. I pursued boxing for some years and am excited to get back into it here in NYC. Also, I love food as well, cooking too!.

		Here a pic of my dog:
