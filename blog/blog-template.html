  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

  It was a little difficult because we both had different ideas but it was great to share them as well. In the end we were bale to come together and create very similar wireframes.

  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

  I found it to be very helpful. Once I had the visual idea it was very easy to code it and change things sround.

  What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

  At this instant in our bootcamp experience we wanted something simple, attractive to the eye and organized.
  We wanted to portray our knowledge without going far off what we had learned.

  What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

  I learned <main></main> , <article></article> and <time></time>.
