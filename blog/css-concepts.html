    <p>
      CSS is a very powerful language created for styling your html files. With it we can play with colors, fonts, backgrounds etc as well as positioning of the content to be viewed.

      So lets dive in.....

      First well talk about the some properties that are hard to grasp but essencial for CSS styling ---> Borders, Margins and Padding. 

      So everything that is declared in html has to be between a set of tags that in some ways creates a container for the things we want to display in our website. Well this container has certain areas for which its dimensions can be defined with CSS.

      Lets say we contain an image with the img tag. Well this is now in an invisible container like a box. Well this box would be like the border and you can make it any color and make the sides of the box be different sizes.

      The space between the container and the actual image that it contains is called padding. The more space you want bewteen the image and the box the more padding you will need and the bigger the box.

      Finally, the space outside the box is called margins. This defines the space between the actual box and things in the webpage like the webpage borders or another image thats in the same page.

    Another important concept are classes and ids

    <p>
      Classes and ids are basically the same thing. They are a block of code that styles a certain tag that is referencing the selector(class or id). The great difference is that a class can be used generally but an id is specific and can be used only once.

      So use a class when trying to style a number of things and us an id when you need to chnage one and only one of those number of things.

    The terror of positioning.....

    <p>
      Positioning is porbably one of the hardest concepts. Its all about learning what each property entails and when to use them.

      At first all elements in your html have a static position, that is the position that the webpage assigns it by default. Now, knowing this we can change this by changing the positioning value.

      So, if we want to give an element a specific and permanent position in the webpage so it will always appear even when scrolling up and down we use the "fixed" value for position. This element will stay in one place and will always be visible in the webpage.

      Now if we want to change the default position we can also use the "relative" value. This will make position changes (top, left, bottom, right) relative to the static positioning of the element or the default position it would take if no positioning value was added.

      Finally if we want to give a specific position to an element in the webpage layout we use the absolute value. This property differs to the fixed property because the element will not always be visible when scrolling up and down.

    </p>

    Block vs Inline-Block

    <p>
      One last concepts is the display property. This property alters how and item is displayed, example in a line with other elements or separated by creating a "block" around it.

      When we set the value for this property to block we basically create a container for the element that will remove any other element to its sides and position them below. The inline value does the exact opposite, it makes it so the elements are in a line, one next to each other. 

      Now when we combine both, we create a hybrid that has boxes that are next to each other. This is great for navigation bars.

      So, thats all for this week. These are hard concepts that require practice to get and even now I feel like I still need more time to master them.
