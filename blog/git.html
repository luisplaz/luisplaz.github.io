      I would expect this was a rough week for most of you being our backgrounds very different to programming and the work load very demanding, so I’ll make this post simple.

      I’ve been trying to wrap my brain around all the information that was given to us during our first week and after a lot, and I mean lot of trials and errors (Basically I erased my repositories twice…). I was able to finally understand what this whole deal about version control, git hub, bit bash, cloning, committing, etc….. Was, and I guess I’d like to share what I though was most important in this post for personal future reference and maybe to help someone out there.

      </p>

      Let’s start with version control.

       <p>
      Version control was easy for me to understand with the checkpoint save in games reference but for those who don’t play video games it is in essence creating various versions of a project each with a higher level of completion. It’s like the various versions of documents we may have when writing a paper that let us check our progress and remember why we made changes in the first place and where we made them.
      We can benefit from this because of the fact that in programming as I’ve been able to experience mistakes are very common and being able to go back to a state where that mistake was not made and where we don’t have to start from zero isn’t only time saving but it also makes us less scared of making mistakes and enables us to be more creative and daring.

        <p>
      On to git we see how it keeps track of out every move during changes and lets us store the relevant information about said change. This, as stated, before lets us understand why changes were made not only personally but to our group if we are connected through GitHub. 
      Git and Github align through the web and work together to manage team contributions. As I understood it I use git in my machine to make changes and then I push these changes (With the relevant commits) into my remote profile in Github, allowing my team members to see what I have changed and why and let them comment and approve of these changes.
       </p>
        <p>
      So once again Git is personal and stores repositories in your personal computer so you can work wherever you are and once you have something you want to share and update you push this information to the remote platform that works hand in hand with git (Github). I think it’s important to mention that the pull command does the exact contrary to push, with pull we incorporate changes approved in Github to our personal computer, so we are always to date with the team’s repository.
       </p>
        <p>
      As a final note, and sharing lessons that I learned the hard way. If you change from a branch to the master branch you will see the master branch as it was originally, do not mistake this with the information being deleted in other branches. The information is still there but git is only showing you what it looks like now without pushing the information or merging the branch. Once on the branch made for the changes you’ll see the information again.

      Hope this helps
