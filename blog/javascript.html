      In this blog post I will address the difference between ruby classes and javascript constructor function.

      Lets strat with ruby:

      In ruby when creating a new object using the new method on a class object. The class object will basically contain functions that initialize the fundamental variables that define this object and the things this object can do.

      Heres we have an example of creating a new instance of the class dog.

    </p>

    <pre>

    class Dog

    def initialize

    @name: "Rufus"
    @breed: "Beagle"
    @color: "Brown"

    end

    def bark

    print 'woof'

    end

    --------------

    new_dog = Dog.new

    new_dog.bark

    </pre>

    <p>

    In this code we create a dog class that when called on with the new method will define the new variable as a new dog with the variables stated in initialize and the method bark that makes the dog bark.

    So the code in the end will make this instance of new_dog print woof.

    Now in Javascript, we can create object using the object literal method like so:

    </p>

    <pre>

    new_dog = {

    name:"Rufus",
    breed: "Beagle",
    color: "Brown",
    }

    </pre>

    <p>

    Or we can use the new operator on a constructor function. This function is called cosntructor because it will construct the object with the information it has within, it workd the same way as the initialize method from java.

    This works like so:

    </p>

    <pre>

    function Create_dog() {

    this.name = "Rufus";
    this.breed = "Beagle";
    this.color = "Brown";

    }

    new_dog = new Create_dog()

    </pre>

    <p>
    In conclusion these are the basic differences between ruby object creation and javascript object creation. Please refer to this <a href="http://stantona.github.io/blog/2012/12/20/a-tale-of-two-object-models-javascript-and-ruby-part-2/"> link</a> for a more in depth explanation.
