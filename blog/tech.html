      In this blog post I will address the subject of recursion and how to implement it in a basic form.

      A simple way of explaining recursion is to describe it as doing something that requires the completion of something previous to be executed.

      So a mathematical expression that can explain this in a simple fashion is this one:

    </p>

    <pre>

    A(N) = A(N-1) + 1

    </pre>

    <p>

    Here we have a method A(N), what it does is it adds one to the previous number to A(N) in the number line. So if we want to find out A(4), we need to know what is A(3).

    We call this recursion. We need to call on the same method to find out A(3). And when we want to find out A(3) we need to know A(2) and so on......

    In the end the whole process is like so, for this explanation well take A(1) to be 2.

    </p>

    <pre>

     A(4) = A(3) + 1

     Recursion

     A(3) = A(2) + 1

     Recursion

     A(2) = A(1) + 1

    </pre>

    <p>

    So we can see that as soon as we reach A(1) which we do know we can solve all other ecuations that in essence were identical to each previous one only that the method was being called upon a different number of N. 

    The final result would be:

    </p>

    <pre>

     A(4) = A(3) + 1

     Recursion

     A(3) = A(2) + 1

     Recursion

     A(2) = A(1) + 1

     A(1) = 2

     A(2) = 2 + 1 = 3

     A(3) = 3 + 1 = 4

     A(4) = 4 + 1 = 5

    </pre>

    <p>

    In conclusion once you figure out if recursion is the right way to go for a certain solution, it should work as stated below, forming a loop that calls on the same method with different variable until we stumble upon one we know and can solve all the other because there is a path that joins them all.
